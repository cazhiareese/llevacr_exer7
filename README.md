**Front End Scripting - Exercise 7**

A javascript program that uses Document Object Model to demonstrate front end scripting.  
Express JS is used to host the static HTML files.  
HTML and CSS were used for styling.  
form.js contains specification on DOM handling. It uses DOM to treat the html elements in index.html as nodes.   
It also adds event scipting to the front end design.  


This repository has the index html file and other necessary resources inside the static files folder.   
server.js serves the static files.

Run server.js to test view the exercise  
Before that, run first  

    npm install
